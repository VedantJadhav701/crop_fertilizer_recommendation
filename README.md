🌾 Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning
🔍 Overview
This project aims to empower farmers and agriculture enthusiasts with data-driven recommendations for crop and fertilizer selection based on real-time environmental inputs. By leveraging machine learning models and building an intuitive Streamlit web application, the system provides smart agricultural guidance, improving crop yield, soil health, and income predictability.

🎯 Objectives
Understand the role of Machine Learning (ML) in agriculture.

Build models to recommend suitable crops and fertilizers based on soil and climate features.

Develop a real-time web application for user-friendly interaction and recommendations.

Integrate live market data and crop season insights for region-specific planning.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python – Core programming language

Scikit-learn – ML algorithms (Random Forest), preprocessing, evaluation

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Streamlit – Web app development and deployment

LabelEncoder & StandardScaler – Feature encoding and normalization

Kaggle Datasets – Reliable agricultural data (CSV format)

Agmarknet API Scraping – Real-time market data

📊 Problem Statement
Farmers often face:

Lack of knowledge on suitable crops and fertilizers

Overuse or misuse of fertilizers

Inaccurate income estimates

Traditional, non-data-driven farming decisions

Absence of personalized, region-specific recommendations

✅ Our Solution
📈 Data-Driven Crop Suggestions – Based on N, P, K values, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall

🌿 Fertilizer Recommendations – Balanced NPK guidance using ML classification

🧠 ML-Powered Predictions – Accurate results using Random Forest Classifier

🗺️ Region-Specific Insights – Seasonal suitability & income estimates by state

📉 Market Price Integration – Live price data from Agmarknet via a scraping module

⚙️ Methodology
Data Collection & Cleaning
Collected agricultural datasets from Kaggle and government sources. Cleaned and preprocessed using standard scaling.

Feature Selection & Modeling
Key features: N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall. Used Random Forest for both crop and fertilizer classification.

Model Evaluation
